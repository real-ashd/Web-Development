<h1>History of Department</h1>
<p class="h4">The Department of Statics is striving hard towards the goal of providing innovative and quality education with high standard to achieve academic excellence and provides platform for the students to achieve their career goals.With Tamso Maa Jyotirgamaya as its guiding principle, the Vidarbha Shikshan Prasarak  Mandal, Khamgaon founded the Govindram Seksariya Science College in 1947 with donation given by Late Seth Govindram Seksaria of Indore in order to cultivate the values of modesty, brotherhood, devotion, courage, patriotism, discipline, sacrifice, patience and determination in the youth of the post-independence era. . The late Advocate Raobahadur Anant Sakharam Athalye of Akola was the first president of the VSP Mandal while there were some prominent citizens of Khamgaon among the founder members. The VSP Mandal is registered under B.P.T. Act, 1950 with registration no. F-1 Buldana. In 1954, the Faculty of Arts was established while the Faculty of Commerce stared from 1957. Thus, G. S. Science College, Khamgaon evolved into G. S. Science, Arts and Commerce College, Khamgaon. In 1968, two post-graduate courses- M.A. (Economics) and M.Com. started. From the year 2000, we started offering post-graduate courses in English, Hindi and Marathi. These three courses are self-financed. We have also started M.Sc. in Computer Science since 2008-09. The college has its own spacious building with total campus area of 99 acres. There are well-equipped and modern laboratories and a library enriched with more than 60,000 books. We have a botanical garden and a hostel with a capacity for 100 students. Recently, we have constructed a Women’s Hostel with financial assistance from the University Grants Commission. Six staff quarters and a huge playground (which also has a turf cricket pitch prepared recently in collaboration with the Vidarbha Cricket Association, Nagpur), the National Cadet Corpse (N.C.C.) and National Service Scheme (N.S.S.) units, a Science Forum as well as a centre of the Yashwantrao Chavan Open University (YCMOU) make us proud. Thus this oldest college in the western part of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra is continuously treading the path of academic excellence.
